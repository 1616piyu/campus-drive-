# Deviations from AI Suggestions

1. **Database Choice**
   - AI suggested using PostgreSQL or MySQL for scalability.
   - I chose **SQLite** because it is lightweight and sufficient for the prototype.

2. **Authentication**
   - AI recommended OAuth-based login for students and admins.
   - I simplified it to **Student ID login** for students and a default admin credential.

3. **User Interface**
   - AI suggested creating a working mobile app prototype.
   - I decided to include only **UI mockups/wireframes** instead of a full mobile app.

4. **Reports**
   - AI suggested using BI dashboards (Tableau/PowerBI).
   - I decided to keep it simple by generating **CSV outputs and screenshots**.

5. **Data Management**
   - AI mentioned separate datasets per college for multi-tenancy.
   - I decided to maintain **one dataset with College ID field** to differentiate records.

These deviations were made to balance **time constraints, simplicity, and assignment requirements**.
